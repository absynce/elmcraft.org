These pages contain history and cultural knowledge in the Elm community written down to make it more accessible to everyone.


### The writing of a thing changes it

A downside of documenting Lore is that you alter its nature somewhat. You calcify a little its flexibility to keep changing, and you influence future readers.

Like a photograph of a moment in time, the photographer adds composition, perspective and framing (selection and exclusion).

Inevitably there is no *objective* Lore. Authors leave their subjective fingerprint on what they write.

So the pages under Lore are framed in the following ways to try mitigate some of the downsides:

- The future isn't fixed by the past, things can and will change
- Don’t assume, and if you must, assume people aren’t malicious
- Focus on solutions and personal action
- Promote the future of Elm

All Elmcraft Lore articles clearly mark their authors and editors.
