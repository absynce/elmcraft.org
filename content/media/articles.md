This is super WIP â€“ [please help contribute](https://github.com/elmcraft/elmcraft.org/edit/main/content/media/articles.md)!

Eventually the plan is to make a page similar to [Videos](https://elmcraft.org/media/videos) so please note applicable [Categories](https://github.com/elmcraft/elmcraft.org/blob/main/src/Types.elm#L100) if you're adding links ðŸ’œ

  - [The Mechanics of Maybe](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/maybe-mechanics)
  - [Problem Solving with Maybe](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/problem-solving-with-maybe)
- 2-part series introducing working with custom types
